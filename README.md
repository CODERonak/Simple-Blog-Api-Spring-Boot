Just built the simple blog api using the spring boot, security, jpa, h2 database, lombok. 
For testing my spring security skills. I might have done lot of mistakes but if you think it can be better, please let me know. 
I have implemented features like for public viewing the posts without any authentication, by id, also auth for registration, login, then also worked in post creation, dashboard which shows post created by you, edit them, deletion, updation
